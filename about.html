<h1>About the Garfield Cult</h1>
  
  <p>
  The Garfield cult strives to convert any and all people we see.&nbsp; </p>
  
  <p>
    Our mission is simple: to spread the joy and humor of Garfield across the globe. We believe that Garfield's witty remarks, lasagna obsession, and disdain for Mondays resonate with people of all ages, bringing smiles to faces and brightening even the dullest days.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As a member of the Garfield Cult, you'll gain access to exclusive torture events, engage in Garfield-themed activities, and connect with fellow fans who share your passion. From sacrifices and meetups to comic strip discussions and bake sales, there's always something exciting happening within our cult .
  </p>
  
  <p>
  So, if you're ready to embrace the Garfield spirit and join a vibrant community of Garfield lovers, we invite you to become a member of the Garfield Cult today. Together, we'll continue to honor and celebrate the legacy of Jim Davis's timeless creation, and worship Godfield.&nbsp; </p>
